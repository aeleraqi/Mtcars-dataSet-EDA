This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the famous **Mtcars** dataset, conducted in a Jupyter Notebook. The analysis aims to provide insights into the relationships between various attributes of cars such as miles per gallon (mpg), weight, horsepower, and others.

## üìÇ File Structure

- **`Mtcars_dataSet_EDA.ipynb`**: This Jupyter notebook contains the code for performing data analysis, including:
  - Data loading and cleaning
  - Descriptive statistics
  - Data visualization using various libraries
  - Insights drawn from the dataset based on correlations and trends

## üì¶ Requirements

To run this notebook, you need the following libraries installed in your Python environment:
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization.
- `scikit-learn`: For additional statistical methods and model-building (if applicable).

You can install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn


üìä Dataset Information
The Mtcars dataset comprises various attributes of cars, including:

mpg: Miles per gallon
cyl: Number of cylinders
disp: Displacement (cu.in.)
hp: Horsepower
wt: Weight (1000 lbs)
qsec: 1/4 mile time
and other features.
This dataset is part of R's base datasets and is widely used for educational purposes in statistics and machine learning.

üîç Notebook Highlights
Data Cleaning: The notebook begins by loading the data, checking for missing values, and performing necessary data cleaning steps.
Data Visualization: Various plots such as histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps are used to explore the relationships between different variables.
Statistical Analysis: Basic descriptive statistics are provided, and trends are explored to understand the dataset's characteristics.
üíª Usage
