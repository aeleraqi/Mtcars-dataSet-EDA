This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the famous **Mtcars** dataset, conducted in a Jupyter Notebook. The analysis aims to provide insights into the relationships between various attributes of cars such as miles per gallon (mpg), weight, horsepower, and others.

## ðŸ“‚ File Structure

- **`Mtcars_dataSet_EDA.ipynb`**: This Jupyter notebook contains the code for performing data analysis, including:
  - Data loading and cleaning
  - Descriptive statistics
  - Data visualization using various libraries
  - Insights drawn from the dataset based on correlations and trends

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

To run this notebook, you need the following libraries installed in your Python environment:
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `numpy`: For numerical operations.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization.
- `scikit-learn`: For additional statistical methods and model-building (if applicable).

You can install the required libraries by running:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
...
